How it works:

***Under Construction Sorry :( ***

1- Sentences are read as statements
2- Sentences are not case sensitive.

ASSIGNMENT:

PRINTING:
-If the first word contains "haykır","söyle","anlat","boş" the sentence is recognized as a print sentence.
-After the first word the first letter of every word that comes after is printed with a few exceptions.
    *If the word is the name of a variable, the value of that variable is printed instead.
    *If the word contains "boş","rahat" -> " " is printed
    *If the word contains "bırak","ayrıl","kır","terk", "\n" is printed.
